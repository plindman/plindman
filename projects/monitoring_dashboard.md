---

## Phase 1: Local Development on WSL

1. Set up Docker and Docker Compose in WSL.
2. Create and test a basic monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana.
3. Configure Prometheus to scrape local metrics.
4. Verify functionality locally.

---

## Phase 2: Deployment on Hetzner Infrastructure

1. Set up Docker and Docker Compose on the Hetzner host.
2. Transfer the monitoring stack configuration from WSL to the Hetzner host.
3. Deploy the monitoring stack on Hetzner.
4. Purchase a domain and configure DNS for remote access.
5. Set up NGINX as a reverse proxy for Prometheus and Grafana.
6. Secure remote access with SSL (optional).

---

## Phase 3: Monitor Docker Containers

1. Deploy cAdvisor on WSL to monitor Docker containers.
2. Deploy cAdvisor on Hetzner to monitor Docker containers.
3. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from both WSL and Hetzner cAdvisor instances.
4. Verify Docker container metrics in Prometheus.

---

## Phase 4: Monitor Host Systems

1. Deploy Node Exporter on WSL to monitor system metrics.
2. Deploy Node Exporter on Hetzner to monitor system metrics.
3. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from both WSL and Hetzner Node Exporter instances.
4. Verify host system metrics in Prometheus.

---

## Phase 5: Integrate Azure Resources

1. Enable Azure Monitor for the desired Azure resources.
2. Install and configure the Azure Monitor plugin in Grafana.
3. Create dashboards for Azure resources, such as:
   - Static website uptime and performance.
   - Storage account usage and metrics.

---

## Phase 6: Create Unified Dashboards

1. Design Grafana dashboards to integrate:
   - Docker container metrics.
   - Host system metrics.
   - Azure resource metrics.
2. Combine all data sources into a single, unified view for end-to-end monitoring.

---

## Phase 7: Set Up Alerts and Notifications

1. Deploy Prometheus Alertmanager.
2. Configure alerting rules in Prometheus for:
   - High resource usage.
   - Service failures or downtime.
3. Set up Grafana alerts for key metrics.
4. Configure notification channels (e.g., Slack, email).

---

## Phase 8: Work on Security

1. **Define Security Requirements**:
   - Identify sensitive components (e.g., credentials, FQDN, IPs).
   - Determine required access control and encryption standards.

2. **Secure Access to Monitoring Stack**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) in Grafana.
   - Secure Prometheus endpoints with basic authentication or reverse proxy rules.

3. **Protect Data in Transit**:
   - Ensure HTTPS is enforced for all external access.
   - Use VPN or firewall rules for internal communication between Prometheus, Grafana, and exporters.

4. **Monitor the Security of the Solution**:
   - Set up dashboards for monitoring unauthorized access attempts.
   - Track SSL certificate expiration and renewal status.

5. **Stay Updated**:
   - Regularly patch and update all software components (Docker images, Prometheus, Grafana, etc.).
   - Monitor for vulnerabilities in the monitoring stack.

---

## Phase 9: Optimize and Maintain

1. Regularly update the monitoring stack and plugins.
2. Optimize scrape intervals and storage settings in Prometheus.
3. Review and refine dashboards and alerts periodically.
4. Add monitoring for new resources or environments as needed.
