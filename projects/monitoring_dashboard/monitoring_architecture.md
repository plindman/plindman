# Monitoring Solution Architecture

This architecture outlines the components and structure of the monitoring solution, which consists of Prometheus, Grafana, and various exporters.

## System Architecture

1. **Centralized Monitoring App**
1. **Adapters on the Monitored Hosts**

### Centralized Monitoring App

- **Role**: Core application responsible for collecting, storing, visualizing metrics, and sending alerts.
- **Deployment**: Can run independently in any environment (local development or production).

### Adapters on the Monitored Hosts

- **Role**: Lightweight components deployed on monitored hosts, exposing system and application metrics to the Monitoring App.
- **Deployment**: Configured and deployed independently of the Monitoring App.

### Relationships Between Roles

1. **Users ↔ Monitoring App**:
   - Users access dashboards hosted on the Monitoring App to view real-time metrics and trends.
   - Users receive alerts from the Monitoring App via configured channels (e.g., email, messaging services).

1. **Monitoring App ↔ Monitored Hosts**:
   - The Monitoring App periodically queries the adapters on the monitored hosts to collect metrics.
   - The monitored host adapters run independently, exposing metrics regardless of the Monitoring App's deployment.
   - Any monitored host can expose metrics to multiple Monitoring App deployments (e.g., both local and production instances).

## Monitoring App

The **Monitoring App** is the centralized system responsible for collecting, storing, visualizing, and alerting on metrics provided by **Adapters on Monitored Hosts**. It is designed for flexibility, allowing deployments in both development and production environments.

- **Role**: Central system responsible for collecting, visualizing, and alerting based on metrics.
- **Core Features**:
  - **Data Collection**: Periodically scrapes metrics from adapters running on monitored hosts.
  - **Visualization**: Displays metrics in user-friendly dashboards for system and application monitoring.
  - **Alerting**: Sends notifications when thresholds or conditions are breached (e.g., resource exhaustion).
- **Components**:
  - **Prometheus**: The main engine for scraping and storing metrics from adapters on monitored hosts.
  - **Grafana**: Provides user-friendly dashboards for visualizing the metrics collected by Prometheus.
  - **Alertmanager**: Integrates with Prometheus to send notifications when predefined thresholds or conditions are met.
- **Deployment**:
  - **Development**: Runs locally for testing and debugging.
  - **Production**: Deployed on production infrastructure to monitor production workloads.

### Prometheus

- The main engine for scraping and storing metrics from adapters on monitored hosts.
- Responsible for querying data for dashboards and alerting purposes.
- Collects data from the adapter endpoints on monitored hosts.
- Stores collected metrics from various sources (exporters, applications, etc.) using a pull model.

### Grafana

- Visualizes Prometheus metrics in the form of dashboards.
- Supports custom panels, filters, and queries for detailed monitoring.

### Alertmanager

- Handles alert notifications generated by Prometheus when certain thresholds are met.
- Alerts for container failures or high resource usage in the local environment.
- Alerts for system-level failures, resource over-utilization, or other critical issues on hosts.
- Configurable to send alerts via email, Slack, or other messaging systems.

## Adapter on Monitored Host

The **Adapter on Monitored Host** is a lightweight, independent component deployed on monitored systems. Its primary responsibility is to expose system and application metrics in a format that the **Monitoring App** (running Prometheus) can scrape and process.

- **Role**: Lightweight components deployed on monitored hosts, exposing system and application metrics to the Monitoring App.
- **Core Features**:
  - **Expose Metrics**: Collect and serve system and application metrics.
  - **Support Monitoring App**: Serve metrics for Prometheus running on the Monitoring App.
- **Key Benefits**:
  - **Simplicity**: Focused on collecting and exposing metrics without additional complexity.
  - **Lightweight**: The adapter does not include heavy components like databases or dashboards. It only exposes metrics.
  - **Scalability**: Supports large-scale monitoring by being lightweight and stateless.
  - **Independent**: Can run without any connection to the centralized Monitoring App. Metrics remain accessible for any compatible scraping tool.
  - **Flexibility**: Works across diverse environments, including local, on-premise, and cloud.
  - **Reusable**: A single adapter can serve multiple Monitoring App deployments (e.g., local dev and production).
  - **Extendability**: Can be enhanced with additional exporters or custom scripts as needed.
- **Components**:
  - **Endpoint for Metrics Exposure**
  - **Exporters**: Expose metrics from the monitored system and applications.
- **Exporter Types**:
  - **System Metrics Exporter**: System-level metrics such as CPU and memory usage.
  - **Application Exporter(s)**: Metrics for specific applications or services, such as Docker containers (e.g., container stats, image usage).
  - **Optional Exporters**: Specific exporters can be added based on the host's environment, such as database and web server metrics.
- **Exporter Software**:
  - **Node Exporter**: Collects system-level metrics (CPU, RAM, disk usage, etc.).
  - **cAdvisor**: Collects Docker container metrics (CPU, memory, network).
- **Deployment**:
  - Runs independently on each monitored host.
  - Configured to expose metrics through standard protocols (e.g., HTTP endpoints for scraping).
- **Supported Hosts**:
  1. **Local WSL Host**:
     - Development environment metrics, including Docker container metrics and local system performance.
  1. **Hetzner Servers**:
     - Production host metrics for VMs, bare-metal servers, and Docker containers.
  1. **Azure Resources**:
     - Metrics for VMs, cloud-hosted applications, and Azure-specific services.
