# 🚀 Welcome! My personal space on the web!
 
I am a tech enthusiast who thrives on diving into new tech realms and turning ambiguous ideas into tangible, working prototypes. My curiosity drives me to continuously learn and apply innovative solutions to real-world challenges. This space is my personal scratchpad for exploring new tools and mastering the art of building fast.

## 🌱 On the Hobby Side

When I’m not building professionally, I’m experimenting with side projects to see how emerging technologies can solve real-world challenges.

- Current Focus: Mastering AI and LLM orchestration.
- Philosophy: Build to learn, iterate rapidly, and focus on the "what if".
- Exploring Frameworks: Deep-diving into modern TS frameworks (e.g., Bun, TanStack) to test the limits of developer velocity.
- Infra & Tooling: Experimenting with modern infrastructure-as-code and deployment workflows.
